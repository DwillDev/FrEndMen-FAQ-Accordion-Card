## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Whilst working on this project, I continued to learn how to properly use the BEM naming convention and how to utilize SCSS to its fullest potential. In addition, I began to learn Git and how version control works.

Most of the things I did in this project were a refresher, so I took the time to further polish my skills and attempted to make the site as responsive as I possibly could. I'm pleased to say that it looks good on a multitude of screens.

### Continued development
 In future projects, I would like to get even better at making my sits responsive. Also, I did not get the chance to use any functions or mixins for this project, so I would like to learn how to implement those in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [ScreenFly](https://screenfly.org/) - This helped me greatly in testing the responsivness of the accordion card on various screen sizes. I will definitely be using it from now on.
